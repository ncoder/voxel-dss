# Voxel Surface Normals

An exploration of **Derived Surface Shading (DSS)** — a family of techniques for lighting voxel
models by the *surface they imply* rather than by the cube faces they are made of.

This repository has two parts:

- **[`whitepaper/`](whitepaper/whitepaper.md)** — the motivation and theory. This is the heart of the
  project: it defines DSS, derives the normal-generation methods, and lays out the design space.
- **[`src/`](src/)** — a small WebGL voxel editor (a MagicaVoxel-inspired UX) built to implement
  those ideas and explore them interactively.

> The whitepaper is the *why*; the app is a hands-on way to see and feel the *what*.

## The idea in one paragraph

Traditional voxel renderers light each visible cube face using its geometric normal (`+X`, `-Y`,
…). This makes lighting describe the voxel *lattice* — emphasizing stair-stepping — instead of the
shape the voxels represent. A voxel model actually contains two representations at once: explicit
cube geometry, and an implicit surface defined by the occupancy field. DSS keeps the cube geometry
(and silhouette) exactly as-is, but derives surface normals from the occupancy field, so that
lighting communicates the larger-scale form. See the
[whitepaper](whitepaper/whitepaper.md) for the full treatment.

The problem splits into two independent axes:

1. **Normal-field generation** — how to extract surface orientation from occupancy.
   - *Density gradient* — the direction from solid space toward empty space (`N = ∇ρ`).
   - *Occupancy centroid* — the direction away from nearby occupied mass (`N = p − C`).
2. **Normal-field application** — how that orientation is used while shading.
   - *Cube faces* — classic per-face geometric normals (the baseline).
   - *Per-voxel* — one derived normal per voxel.
   - *Vertex-interpolated* — derived normals blended at cube corners for continuous, smooth-shaded
     lighting across faces.

Both DSS methods use an adjustable **kernel radius** (`1 → 3³`, up to `4 → 9³`): small kernels
preserve local detail, large kernels communicate global form.

## The editor

The app lets you build voxel models and toggle between shading approaches in real time so you can
directly compare the baseline against DSS.

Features:

- **Sculpt mode** — attach / erase / paint / pick tools, with voxel / box / line / face brushes,
  adjustable brush size, and X/Y/Z mirror symmetry.
- **Tri-view mode** — draw top / front / side silhouettes on planes; the model becomes their
  intersection.
- **DSS shading controls** — pick the normal field (gradient vs. centroid), the application mode
  (cube / per-voxel / vertex-interpolated), and the kernel radius live.
- **Derived ambient occlusion** — occupancy-based AO with per-voxel or vertex-interpolated modes,
  adjustable radius and intensity.
- **Starter shapes**, a customizable **palette**, and **.vox import** (MagicaVoxel files).
- Dynamic lighting (with optional auto-rotation), ground grid, voxel edges, undo/redo, and live
  voxel/face stats.

### Where the DSS implementation lives

- [`src/voxel/dss.ts`](src/voxel/dss.ts) — the core of the paper: gradient and centroid normal
  fields, the kernel/Gaussian weighting, the normal cache, and vertex-interpolated normals.
- [`src/voxel/ao.ts`](src/voxel/ao.ts) — occupancy-derived ambient occlusion.
- [`src/voxel/meshBuilder.ts`](src/voxel/meshBuilder.ts) — builds the cube mesh and applies the
  chosen normals/AO.
- [`src/engine/`](src/engine/) — the Three.js engine, viewport interaction, and tri-view planes.

## Getting started

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (18+).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the dev server (Vite)
```

Then open the printed local URL in a browser.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build     # type-check and build for production
npm run preview   # preview the production build
npm run typecheck # type-check only
npm run lint      # run ESLint
```

## Tech stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for WebGL rendering
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for editor state
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for tooling

## Status

This is a research prototype. The whitepaper outlines several open directions — larger kernels,
alternative weighting functions, GPU normal generation, and DSS combined with palette-quantized
lighting — that remain to be explored.
